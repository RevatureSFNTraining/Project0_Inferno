        Deck, no matter how powerful, begins with a single card. What better cards to begin with than the classic
         deck that inspired a generation? Will you be the next to add the Legendary King of Hearts to your 
         collection?"

        deck-description="The year is 4024, otherwise known as the Year of Broken Hearts. The kingdoms of days past
        fell long ago and now their memory has been reduced to an obsucre meme on the cyber-forums. The last of the
         47 Great Monachs, the TechnoQueen, is making her last stand. Will you end the reign of techno-terror once
         and for all? Will you take the cyber-crown for yourself?"

        deck-description="Who knew that there was more than water beyond the horizon? No one would have believed it
         if we all didn't watch the distant speck on the waterline grow into a recognizable shape. A single ship soon
          became dozens, which then turned into hundreds. The unknown lands of the East have been lost time time; 
          swallowed by the ocean and her refugees now look to establish themselves elsewhere. Will you take up the 
          sword against these invaders or will you pledge your fealty to the Far East?"

        deck-description="The world thought they'd seen the last of Ruthless Jack when the Ace of Spades cast him out
         into the endless sands of the Shuffling Desert. Word of his return reached the kingdom within days. Banished 
         for a full 52 and not only was Jack still alive, word is that he started his own deck. The kingdom wasn't too
          worried about a handful of outlaws with a chip on their shoulder. What did worry them was the sight of four full
           suits riding over the horizon with Revolver Jack at their head and the Ace of Spades in his hands."
