- Submitted my wireframe for my website.  The concept is similar to Loot Crate a monthly subscription service that sends boxes full of pop culture collectibles like toys, clothing, stickers, comics, and other items.  My concept is similar with one difference being that the items being sent are vintage or retro and are of limited quantity.
