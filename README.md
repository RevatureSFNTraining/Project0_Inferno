# Project0_Inferno - AS - Diving Business

## Brainstorming / Ideas:

> I really want to add a paralaxx effect when you scroll you dive deeper into the ocean. foreground effects like boulders at the bottom would b cool
> Moving clouds etc, info text that slides into view as you get to certain points ? - prices slide into view depending on ocean depth
> add progress bar to show depth ? 
> Diving Business header, obv slides out of screen as you scroll
> there should be a button to take you up, maybe a "More info" button at certain diving depths which gives more info on the specific dive, experience needed and pricing cost?

## Update:
>Upon discussion with Instructor determined above idea too complex for what we are looking to do right now. 
>Therefore I will retain the Business Idea however I will simplify the Wireframe


## General Notes - For a successful business:
###### What needs to be on the website

- Amount of money, diff bookings
- location
