#  Diving company - "Name Undecided"


Brainstorming / Ideas:
I really want to add a paralaxx effect when you scroll you dive deeper into the ocean. foreground effects like boulders at the bottom would b cool
Moving clouds etc, info text that slides into view as you get to certain points ? - prices slide into view depending on ocean depth
add progress bar to show depth ? 
Diving Business header, obv slides out of screen as you scroll
there should be a button to take you up, maybe a "More info" button at certain diving depths which gives more info on the specific dive, experience needed and pricing cost? 
- more info button could include the conditional appearance of a text that gives that info, with an x button to make it go away again 

- ideally responsive to different width of mobile and desktop


For a successful business:
- Amount of money, diff bookings
- location
- business name
- needs to show a few divers for sure ideally at different spots
