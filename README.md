- Updated ERD and webpage code. Currently working on UI, Auto Processing, and Salesforce Cloud.

12/18/2021
- Completed and uploaded ERD. Completed data model in Trailhead.

12/15/2021
- Turned in HTML/CSS concept webapge, an updated wireframe, and the incomplete LWC version of the website last night.

12/14/2021
- Im going to complete the webpage with HTML, CSS, and some JS first, then uploaded to git hub, before I tackle the LWC. With LWC, the entire design of the webiste might change.

12/13/2021
- I started working on the HTML, CSS, and JS portions of my webpage while I try to study LWC. Once I figure out LWC I can implement it to the webpage.

12/11/2021
- Continuing to study LWC before I start working on the website. However, I did took some pictures of some collectibles today for the website.

12/10/2021
- Submitted my wireframe for my website.  The concept is similar to Loot Crate a monthly subscription service that sends boxes full of pop culture collectibles like toys, clothing, stickers, comics, and other items.  My concept is similar with one difference being that the items being sent are vintage or retro and are of limited quantity.
